operators in java:
```
operator in java is a symbol which is used
to perform operations.

+,-,*,/ etc...

we have many types of operators in java.

  -Unary Operator
  -Arithmetic Operator
  -Shift Operator
  -Relational Operator
  -Bitwise operator
  -Logical Operator
  -Ternary Operator
  -Assignment Operator
    

-Unary Operator:
````
The java unary operators require only one operand

unary operators are used to perform various operations

 -incrementing / decrementing a value by one
 -negating an expression
 -inverting the value of a boolean
 
 
  postfix  --> expr++, expr--
  
  prefix   -->++expr, --expr
              +expr , -expr 


example:
```

public class Test10 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = 10;
		
		System.out.println(x++);//10
		
		System.out.println(++x);//12
		
		System.out.println(x--);//12
		
		System.out.println(--x);//10
		
	}
}


example:
``
package operators;

public class Test2 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int a = 10;
		int b = 10;
		System.out.println(a++ + ++a);//22
		System.out.println(b++ + b++);//10+11=21
		
	}

}
